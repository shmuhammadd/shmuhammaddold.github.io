  abstract = {With the success of large-scale pre-training
and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have
seen a proliferation of large, web-mined
text datasets covering hundreds of languages.
However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of these publicly
available datasets, or whether the datasets
actually contain content in the languages
they claim to represent. In this work, we
manually audit the quality of 205 languagespecific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4), and audit the correctness
of language codes in a sixth (JW300). We
find that lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: at least 15 corpora are completely
erroneous, and a significant fraction contains
less than 50% sentences of acceptable quality.
Similarly, we find 82 corpora that are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language
codes. We demonstrate that these issues are
easy to detect even for non-speakers of the languages in question, and supplement the human
judgements with automatic analyses. Inspired
by our analysis, we recommend techniques to
evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and
discuss the risks that come with low-quality
data releases.}

	abstract = {Research in NLP lacks geographic diversity, and the question of how NLP can be scaled to low-resourced languages has not yet been adequately solved. "Low-resourced"-ness is a complex problem going beyond data availability and reflects systemic problems in society. In this paper, we focus on the task of Machine Translation (MT), that plays a crucial role for information accessibility and communication worldwide. Despite immense improvements in MT over the past decade, MT is centered around a few high-resourced languages. As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness alone, we propose participatory research as a means to involve all necessary agents required in the MT development process. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of participatory research with a case study on MT for African languages. Its implementation leads to a collection of novel translation datasets, MT benchmarks for over 30 languages, with human evaluations for a third of them, and enables participants without formal training to make a unique scientific contribution.},

Therefore, this article is aimed at determining the sources of data, the techniques, the features, and the evaluation metrics used in movie revenue prediction. We selected 36 relevant articles based defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review analysis found out that US cinema attracted the highest number of publications, followed by the Chinese cinema, Korean cinema, and Indian cinema in that order. We also found out that regression, classification and clustering data mining approaches were used in the reviewed articles, with regression and classification carrying the largest share. Furthermore, we observed that cast, number of screens, and genre, are the most widely used features in movie revenue prediction. We also identified multiple linear regression and support vector machines are the most commonly used prediction algorithms, while mean absolute percentage error, root-mean-square error, and average percentage hit rate are the evaluation metrics used the most. Our review identified some problems and research directions in movie revenue prediction.},

However, timetable schedule forgetfulness, misinterpretation, miscopying, cost of rescheduling and slow time to reach for the rescheduled timetables are the challenges posed by the use of paper and notice board-based timetables; hence, the need for automated timetables. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of Android and web-based timetable customization systems for the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Bayero University, Kano-Nigeria. The web-based system provides an administrative module that facilitates scheduling and rescheduling of lecture, examination and invigilation timetables. In addition, the Android timetable customization system permits the user to view, customize, set reminders and provide rescheduled timetable updates.},

Studies have shown that technology can be used to

framework can likely improve the learning process,
enhance students’ performances, and increase
students’ interest in education. It can also be used to
coordinate and manipulate classroom utilities,
manage students’ attendance and educational
contents. In addition, the paper described the
objectives and implementation considerations for the

some drawbacks within the context of awareness and

rationale of this study is to appraise the level of
awareness, perceived benefits and challenges of
MOOCs adoption among University students of
Kano State, Nigeria. The study was conducted in
form of a survey using structured questionnaire
administered to three hundred (300) randomly
selected respondents. Finding from the study revealed
a variation in the level of awareness among IT and
non IT inclined students. The investigation of MOOC
benefits indicates improved learning performance and
effectiveness among study samples. The study further
revealed user unfriendliness, inadequate Internet
connectivity, power instability and cost of enrolments
as factors influencing slow adoption of MOOC. The
evidence from the study suggests that, awareness and

establishment of hubs, provision of national

	abstract = {Viterbi algorithm is a maximum likelihood decoding algorithm. It is used to decode convolutional code in several wireless communication systems, including Wi-Fi. The standard Viterbi algorithm gives just one decoded output, which may be correct or incorrect. Incorrect packets are normally discarded thereby necessitating retransmission and hence resulting in considerable energy loss and delay. Some real-time applications such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony do not tolerate excessive delay. This makes the conventional Viterbi decoding strategy sub-optimal. In this regard, a modified approach, which involves a form of List Viterbi for decoding the convolutional code is investigated. The technique employed combines the bit-error correction capabilities of both the Viterbi algorithm and the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) procedures. It first uses a form of ‘List Viterbi Algorithm’ (LVA), which generates a list of possible decoded output candidates after the trellis search. The CRC check is then used to determine the presence of correct outcome. Results of experiments conducted using simulation shows considerable improvement in bit-error performance when compared to classical approach.},
