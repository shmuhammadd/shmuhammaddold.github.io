 abstract = {Viterbi algorithm is a maximum likelihood decoding algorithm. It is used to decode convolutional code in several wireless communication systems, including Wi-Fi. The standard Viterbi algorithm gives just one decoded output, which may be correct or incorrect. Incorrect packets are normally discarded thereby necessitating retransmission and hence resulting in considerable energy loss and delay. Some real-time applications such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony do not tolerate excessive delay. This makes the conventional Viterbi decoding strategy sub-optimal. In this regard, a modified approach, which involves a form of List Viterbi for decoding the convolutional code is investigated. The technique employed combines the bit-error correction capabilities of both the Viterbi algorithm and the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) procedures. It first uses a form of ‘List Viterbi Algorithm’ (LVA), which generates a list of possible decoded output candidates after the trellis search. The CRC check is then used to determine the presence of correct outcome. Results of experiments conducted using simulation shows considerable improvement in bit-error performance when compared to classical approach.},
