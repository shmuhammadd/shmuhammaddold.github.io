 abstract = {E-learning systems are increasingly being developed
to replace traditional ways of teaching and learning.
Studies have shown that technology can be used to
create more powerful learning and teaching
opportunities over and above traditional systems.
Despite these promising technologies of the 21st
century, many places of teaching and learning are yet
to attain the minimal educational value. In this paper,
we proposed a conceptual framework that describes
the design and implementation of an ultimate
computerized classroom that uses technology to its
fullest to enhance educational experience. The
framework can likely improve the learning process,
enhance students’ performances, and increase
students’ interest in education. It can also be used to
coordinate and manipulate classroom utilities,
manage students’ attendance and educational
contents. In addition, the paper described the
objectives and implementation considerations for the
realization of e-learning full potentials. This is
followed by an explanation of the design and
implementation details of the three (3) modules that
make the system namely; e-register module, e-control
module and e-board module. Benefits of the system
are explained and the paper review how technology
can be incorporated in school education to provide
students with the skills needed for the 21st century},
