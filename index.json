Therefore, this article is aimed at determining the sources of data, the techniques, the features, and the evaluation metrics used in movie revenue prediction. We selected 36 relevant articles based defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review analysis found out that US cinema attracted the highest number of publications, followed by the Chinese cinema, Korean cinema, and Indian cinema in that order. We also found out that regression, classification and clustering data mining approaches were used in the reviewed articles, with regression and classification carrying the largest share. Furthermore, we observed that cast, number of screens, and genre, are the most widely used features in movie revenue prediction. We also identified multiple linear regression and support vector machines are the most commonly used prediction algorithms, while mean absolute percentage error, root-mean-square error, and average percentage hit rate are the evaluation metrics used the most.

In this paper, we focus on the task of Machine Translation (MT), that plays a crucial role for information accessibility and communication worldwide. Despite immense improvements in MT over the past decade, MT is centered around a few high-resourced languages. As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness alone, we propose participatory research as a means to involve all necessary agents required in the MT development process. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of participatory research with a case study on MT for African languages. Its implementation leads to a collection of novel translation datasets, MT benchmarks for over 30 languages, with human evaluations for a third of them, and enables participants without formal training to make a unique scientific contribution.","tags":[],"title":"Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation: A Case Study in African Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

It is used to decode convolutional code in several wireless communication systems, including Wi-Fi. The standard Viterbi algorithm gives just one decoded output, which may be correct or incorrect. Incorrect packets are normally discarded thereby necessitating retransmission and hence resulting in considerable energy loss and delay. Some real-time applications such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony do not tolerate excessive delay. This makes the conventional Viterbi decoding strategy sub-optimal. In this regard, a modified approach, which involves a form of List Viterbi for decoding the convolutional code is investigated. The technique employed combines the bit-error correction capabilities of both the Viterbi algorithm and the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) procedures. It first uses a form of ‘List Viterbi Algorithm’ (LVA), which generates a list of possible decoded output candidates after the trellis search. The CRC check is then used to determine the presence of correct outcome. Results of experiments conducted using simulation shows considerable improvement in bit-error performance when compared to classical approach.","tags":[],"title":"A Form of List Viterbi Algorithm for Decoding Convolutional Codes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

University timetabling entails the scheduling of times and venues for lectures and examinations. These activities are logically structured in a time-wise manner and presented on papers and placed on notice boards in order to avoid conflicts of event. However, timetable schedule forgetfulness, misinterpretation, miscopying, cost of rescheduling and slow time to reach for the rescheduled timetables are the challenges posed by the use of paper and notice board-based timetables; hence, the need for automated timetables. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of Android and web-based timetable customization systems for the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Bayero University, Kano-Nigeria. The web-based system provides an administrative module that facilitates scheduling and rescheduling of lecture, examination and invigilation timetables.

Studies have shown that technology can be used to create more powerful learning and teaching opportunities over and above traditional systems. Despite these promising technologies of the 21st century, many places of teaching and learning are yet to attain the minimal educational value. In this paper, we proposed a conceptual framework that describes the design and implementation of an ultimate computerized classroom that uses technology to its fullest to enhance educational experience. The framework can likely improve the learning process, enhance students’ performances, and increase students’ interest in education. It can also be used to coordinate and manipulate classroom utilities, manage students’ attendance and educational contents. In addition, the paper described the objectives and implementation considerations for the realization of e-learning full potentials. This is followed by an explanation of the design and implementation details of the three (3) modules that make the system namely; e-register module, e-control module and e-board module. Benefits of the system are explained and the paper review how technology can be incorporated in school education to provide students with the skills needed for the 21st century","tags":[],"title":"A Framework for Implementation of E-Classroom System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdulrasheed Mustapha","Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad","Saheed Abdullahi Salahudeen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169701,"objectID":"e72cc766b8715c705da638f3276d7b8c","permalink":"https://shmuhammadd.github.io/publication/mustapha-massive-open-online-2016/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:01:41.593138Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mustapha-massive-open-online-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Cloud computing is fast becoming the major computing paradigm in every aspect of teaching and learning. This computing paradigm supported the emergence of new learning and teaching platform called Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). MOOC is mainly delivered via the cloud and it uses the Internet to make education infinitely available to an unlimited scope of participants. This paper focuses on exploring MOOC as the success of cloud computing in education. A qualitative approach of data collection, selection and analysis were used to systematically review 149 literature for the study. The results of the study showed Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) as the major cloud service model used in education. Additionally, Coursera, edX, Udemy, Udacity and FutureLearn are the major MOOC providers using cloud services and resources to globally promote qualitative teaching and learning. Finally, the study outlined the characteristics, types, problems, and prospects of MOOC for education delivery","tags":[],"title":"Massive Open Online Courses: A Success of Cloud Computing in Education.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Recently, MOOC is globally becoming a key instrument in digitally mediated learning and teaching, due to its ability to provide interactive user forums to support community interactions among participants and instructors. Despite its global acceptance, countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffer some drawbacks within the context of awareness and adoption. Kano state is one of the cities in SubSaharan Africa with high population where MOOCs participation is significantly needed. Therefore, the rationale of this study is to appraise the level of awareness, perceived benefits and challenges of MOOCs adoption among University students of Kano State, Nigeria. The study was conducted in form of a survey using structured questionnaire administered to three hundred (300) randomly selected respondents. Finding from the study revealed a variation in the level of awareness among IT and non IT inclined students. The investigation of MOOC benefits indicates improved learning performance and effectiveness among study samples. The study further revealed user unfriendliness, inadequate Internet connectivity, power instability and cost of enrolments as factors influencing slow adoption of MOOC. The evidence from the study suggests that, awareness and adoption of MOOCs can be enhanced through establishment of hubs, provision of national accredited curriculum and subsidized cost of enrollments.","tags":[],"title":"Massive Open Online Courses: Awareness, Adoption, Benefits and Challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
