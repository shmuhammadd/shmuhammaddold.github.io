Hello and welcome to my website! This is where I post my notes and tutorials on a variety of topics that I find intriguing and useful. I also use this website as a personal archive, since I have a habit of forgetting things easily. By writing down what I learn, I can revisit and refresh my memory anytime. ðŸ“š

I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity and helps you learn something new. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
