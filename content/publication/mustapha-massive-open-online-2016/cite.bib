 abstract = {Cloud computing is fast becoming the major computing paradigm in
every aspect of teaching and learning. This computing paradigm
supported the emergence of new learning and teaching platform called
Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). MOOC is mainly delivered via
the cloud and it uses the Internet to make education infinitely available
to an unlimited scope of participants. This paper focuses on exploring
MOOC as the success of cloud computing in education. A qualitative
approach of data collection, selection and analysis were used to
systematically review 149 literature for the study. The results of the
study showed Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a
Service (SaaS) as the major cloud service model used in education.
Additionally, Coursera, edX, Udemy, Udacity and FutureLearn are the
major MOOC providers using cloud services and resources to globally
promote qualitative teaching and learning. Finally, the study outlined
the characteristics, types, problems, and prospects of MOOC for
education delivery},
