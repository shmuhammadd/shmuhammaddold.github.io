abstract: Cloud computing is fast becoming the major computing paradigm in every aspect
  of teaching and learning. This computing paradigm supported the emergence of new
  learning and teaching platform called Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). MOOC is
  mainly delivered via the cloud and it uses the Internet to make education infinitely
  available to an unlimited scope of participants. This paper focuses on exploring
  MOOC as the success of cloud computing in education. A qualitative approach of data
  collection, selection and analysis were used to systematically review 149 literature
  for the study. The results of the study showed Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  and Software as a Service (SaaS) as the major cloud service model used in education.
  Additionally, Coursera, edX, Udemy, Udacity and FutureLearn are the major MOOC providers
  using cloud services and resources to globally promote qualitative teaching and
  learning. Finally, the study outlined the characteristics, types, problems, and
  prospects of MOOC for education delivery
