abstract: With the growing number of literature on movie revenue prediction using
  machine learning techniques in recent years, a systemic review will help in strengthening
  the understanding of this research domain. Therefore, this article is aimed at determining
  the sources of data, the techniques, the features, and the evaluation metrics used
  in movie revenue prediction. We selected 36 relevant articles based defined inclusion
  and exclusion criteria. The review analysis found out that US cinema attracted the
  highest number of publications, followed by the Chinese cinema, Korean cinema, and
  Indian cinema in that order. We also found out that regression, classification and
  clustering data mining approaches were used in the reviewed articles, with regression
  and classification carrying the largest share. Furthermore, we observed that cast,
  number of screens, and genre, are the most widely used features in movie revenue
  prediction. We also identified multiple linear regression and support vector machines
  are the most commonly used prediction algorithms, while mean absolute percentage
  error, root-mean-square error, and average percentage hit rate are the evaluation
  metrics used the most. Our review identified some problems and research directions
  in movie revenue prediction.
