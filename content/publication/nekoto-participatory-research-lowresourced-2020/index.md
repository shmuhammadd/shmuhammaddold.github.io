abstract: Research in NLP lacks geographic diversity, and the question of how NLP
  can be scaled to low-resourced languages has not yet been adequately solved. \"Low-resourced\"-ness
  is a complex problem going beyond data availability and reflects systemic problems
  in society. In this paper, we focus on the task of Machine Translation (MT), that
  plays a crucial role for information accessibility and communication worldwide.
  Despite immense improvements in MT over the past decade, MT is centered around a
  few high-resourced languages. As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness
  alone, we propose participatory research as a means to involve all necessary agents
  required in the MT development process. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability
  of participatory research with a case study on MT for African languages. Its implementation
  leads to a collection of novel translation datasets, MT benchmarks for over 30 languages,
  with human evaluations for a third of them, and enables participants without formal
  training to make a unique scientific contribution.
