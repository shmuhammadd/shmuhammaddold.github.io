 abstract = {Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an
emerging learning platform aimed at infinite
participation and access through the Internet.
Recently, MOOC is globally becoming a key
instrument in digitally mediated learning and
teaching, due to its ability to provide interactive user
forums to support community interactions among
participants and instructors. Despite its global
acceptance, countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffer
some drawbacks within the context of awareness and
adoption. Kano state is one of the cities in SubSaharan Africa with high population where MOOCs
participation is significantly needed. Therefore, the
rationale of this study is to appraise the level of
awareness, perceived benefits and challenges of
MOOCs adoption among University students of
Kano State, Nigeria. The study was conducted in
form of a survey using structured questionnaire
administered to three hundred (300) randomly
selected respondents. Finding from the study revealed
a variation in the level of awareness among IT and
non IT inclined students. The investigation of MOOC
benefits indicates improved learning performance and
effectiveness among study samples. The study further
revealed user unfriendliness, inadequate Internet
connectivity, power instability and cost of enrolments
as factors influencing slow adoption of MOOC. The
evidence from the study suggests that, awareness and
adoption of MOOCs can be enhanced through
establishment of hubs, provision of national
accredited curriculum and subsidized cost of
enrollments.},
