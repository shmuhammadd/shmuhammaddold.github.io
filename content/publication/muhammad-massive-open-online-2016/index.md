abstract: Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an emerging learning platform aimed
  at infinite participation and access through the Internet. Recently, MOOC is globally
  becoming a key instrument in digitally mediated learning and teaching, due to its
  ability to provide interactive user forums to support community interactions among
  participants and instructors. Despite its global acceptance, countries in sub-Saharan
  Africa suffer some drawbacks within the context of awareness and adoption. Kano
  state is one of the cities in SubSaharan Africa with high population where MOOCs
  participation is significantly needed. Therefore, the rationale of this study is
  to appraise the level of awareness, perceived benefits and challenges of MOOCs adoption
  among University students of Kano State, Nigeria. The study was conducted in form
  of a survey using structured questionnaire administered to three hundred (300) randomly
  selected respondents. Finding from the study revealed a variation in the level of
  awareness among IT and non IT inclined students. The investigation of MOOC benefits
  indicates improved learning performance and effectiveness among study samples. The
  study further revealed user unfriendliness, inadequate Internet connectivity, power
  instability and cost of enrolments as factors influencing slow adoption of MOOC.
  The evidence from the study suggests that, awareness and adoption of MOOCs can be
  enhanced through establishment of hubs, provision of national accredited curriculum
  and subsidized cost of enrollments.
