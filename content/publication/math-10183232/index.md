abstract: This paper describes two different approaches to sentiment analysis. The
  first is a form of symbolic approach that exploits a sentiment lexicon together
  with a set of shifter patterns and rules. The sentiment lexicon includes single
  words (unigrams) and is developed automatically by exploiting labeled examples.
  The shifter patterns include intensification, attenuation/downtoning and inversion/reversal
  and are developed manually. The second approach exploits a deep neural network,
  which uses a pre-trained language model. Both approaches were applied to texts on
  economics and finance domains from newspapers in European Portuguese. We show that
  the symbolic approach achieves virtually the same performance as the deep neural
  network. In addition, the symbolic approach provides understandable explanations,
  and the acquired knowledge can be communicated to others. We release the shifter
  patterns to motivate future research in this direction.
