abstract: 'Sentiment analysis is a relatively new field of study at the intersection
  of computer science and linguistics that aims to find an opinion expressed in a
  text. It has received a swell of interest in both academia and industry. This paper
  provides an overview of the basic approaches for sentiment analysis task: machine
  learning-based approach and lexicon-based approach. The machine learning approach
  is based on training models on corpora annotated with polarity information and the
  lexiconbased approach is based on using sentiment lexicon. Recently, a hybrid approach
  is employed to leverage the strength of both two approaches'
