 abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a relatively new field of study
at the intersection of computer science and linguistics that aims
to find an opinion expressed in a text. It has received a swell
of interest in both academia and industry. This paper provides
an overview of the basic approaches for sentiment analysis task:
machine learning-based approach and lexicon-based approach.
The machine learning approach is based on training models on
corpora annotated with polarity information and the lexiconbased approach is based on using sentiment lexicon. Recently,
a hybrid approach is employed to leverage the strength of both
two approaches},
