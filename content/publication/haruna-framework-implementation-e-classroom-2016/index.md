abstract: E-learning systems are increasingly being developed to replace traditional
  ways of teaching and learning. Studies have shown that technology can be used to
  create more powerful learning and teaching opportunities over and above traditional
  systems. Despite these promising technologies of the 21st century, many places of
  teaching and learning are yet to attain the minimal educational value. In this paper,
  we proposed a conceptual framework that describes the design and implementation
  of an ultimate computerized classroom that uses technology to its fullest to enhance
  educational experience. The framework can likely improve the learning process, enhance
  students’ performances, and increase students’ interest in education. It can also
  be used to coordinate and manipulate classroom utilities, manage students’ attendance
  and educational contents. In addition, the paper described the objectives and implementation
  considerations for the realization of e-learning full potentials. This is followed
  by an explanation of the design and implementation details of the three (3) modules
  that make the system namely; e-register module, e-control module and e-board module.
  Benefits of the system are explained and the paper review how technology can be
  incorporated in school education to provide students with the skills needed for
  the 21st century
