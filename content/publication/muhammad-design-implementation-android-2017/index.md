abstract: Timetabling is an essential component of scheduling in all sectors of education.
  University timetabling entails the scheduling of times and venues for lectures and
  examinations. These activities are logically structured in a time-wise manner and
  presented on papers and placed on notice boards in order to avoid conflicts of event.
  However, timetable schedule forgetfulness, misinterpretation, miscopying, cost of
  rescheduling and slow time to reach for the rescheduled timetables are the challenges
  posed by the use of paper and notice board-based timetables; hence, the need for
  automated timetables. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of Android and
  web-based timetable customization systems for the Faculty of Computer Science and
  Information Technology, Bayero University, Kano-Nigeria. The web-based system provides
  an administrative module that facilitates scheduling and rescheduling of lecture,
  examination and invigilation timetables. In addition, the Android timetable customization
  system permits the user to view, customize, set reminders and provide rescheduled
  timetable updates.
